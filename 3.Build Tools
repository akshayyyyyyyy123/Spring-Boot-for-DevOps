- Building tools in Java involves creating applications, libraries, or frameworks that assist developers in the process of software development.

- These tools automate the process of compiling, packaging, and deploying applications. 


MAVEN
  - It is a build automation tool primarily used for Java projects. 
  - manages project builds, dependencies, and documentation.
  - uses a standardized directory layout and a file called pom.xml (Project Object Model) to define project dependencies, plugins, and build configurations.
  - automatically downloads and includes libraries (dependencies) your project needs from a central repository.
  - extends functionality via plugins, like compiling code, running tests, and packaging applications.

In simple terms: Think of Maven as a smart assistant that helps you compile your Java code, manage the libraries you need, and package your application neatly, all based on a simple, standardized configuration file.


GRADLE
  - Gradle is another build automation tool, also used for Java projects.
  - Similar to Maven, but more flexible and powerful.
  - Uses a file called build.gradle for configuration, written in Groovy or Kotlin, which is more flexible and allows for custom scripting.
  - Also manages and downloads project dependencies automatically.
  - Supports plugins for additional functionality, and its flexibility makes it suitable for complex projects.

In simple terms: Gradle is like Maven's more flexible cousin. It not only helps you compile, manage libraries, and package your code but also lets you customize almost everything with a more powerful scripting language.
