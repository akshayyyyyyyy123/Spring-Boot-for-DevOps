- Tomcat is also known as Apache Tomcat.

- Tomcat is a software that helps run Java applications on web servers. Itâ€™s particularly good at handling Java-based web applications.

- Apache Tomcat, often referred to simply as Tomcat, is an open-source implementation of the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages (JSP), Java Expression Language (EL), and Java WebSocket technologies. It is developed and maintained by the Apache Software Foundation.

KEY FEATURES:
- Servlet Container
- JSP Support
- Websocket Support
- Extensibility
- Security

* Java Servlet: 
	- It is a Java program that runs on a server. It is responsible for handling requests from web browsers and sends back responses. 	
Example: When you submit a form on a website, a servlet might process the form data and return a web page with the results.

* JavaServer Pages (JSP):
	- It allows you to create dynamically generated web pages using Java.
	- Creates the structure and content of web pages, embedding Java code as needed.

* Java Expression Language (EL):
	-  A language used in JSP to simplify the access and manipulation of data.
	-  Makes it easier to access and display data without writing complex Java code.

* WebSocket Support:
	- WebSocket support in Tomcat allows for real-time, full-duplex communication between a client (like a web browser) and a server. This means that both the client and the server can send and receive messages at any time.
