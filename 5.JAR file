* JAR (Java Archive):

  -> PURPOSE
	- JAR files are primarily used for packaging Java classes, libraries, resources, and metadata into a single compressed file. They are used for standalone Java applications or libraries.

    - Java classes, dependenices, config files, libraries are packaged into a single file for distribution, deployment and execution.


   -> STRUCTURE
	  - Compiled Classes: Contains .class files which are the compiled bytecode of Java source files.

	  -  Resources: May include resources such as images, properties files, or any other data files needed by the application.

	  - META-INF Directory: Contains metadata about the JAR file. Key files in this directory include: 
	      - MANIFEST.MF: A manifest file that can contain information about the files in the JAR, such as the main class to run when the JAR is executed.

	-> Root Directory has:
			i) Compiled classes (.class) of your java programs
			ii) Resources contains non-code resources required by the application, such as configuration files, images, and other data files.

	-> META-INF Directory
			i) MANIFEST.MF:
				- A special file that contains metadata about the JAR file.
				- It can specify the main class of the application, version information, and other configuration details.
				example: 
				    	Manifest-Version: 1.0
						Main-Class: com.example.MainClass

	-> BOOT-INF Directory (/classes and /lib)
			i) BOOT-INF/classes: Contains the compiled classes (.class) and application.properties files.
						BOOT-INF/classes/
						|-- com/
						|   |-- example/
						|       |-- MySpringBootApplication.class
						|       |-- service/
						|           |-- MyService.class
						|-- application.properties

			ii) BOOT-INF/lib: Contains the JAR files of all dependencies required by the application.			
					       BOOT-INF/lib/
						   |-- spring-core-5.3.8.jar
						   |-- spring-boot-starter-web-2.5.2.jar
						   |-- mysql-connector-java-8.0.25.jar


	-> SUMMARY
		Root Directory: Contains the main contents of the JAR, including all classes and resources, organized according to their package structure.
		META-INF Directory: Contains the MANIFEST.MF file and any other metadata necessary for the application or library.					
		BOOT-INF Directory: contains all the compiled classes of your java program and dependencies required by application.
