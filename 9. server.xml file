1. server.xml
	- The server.xml file is a configuration file used by Apache Tomcat, a popular Java Servlet Container.
	- This file configures how Tomcat serves applications and handles requests.

	What does it contain?

		i) Server Element(top-level element): defines the entire server configuration. It s like a secret code word used to safely turn off the server.
		- To turn off the server, connect to the port 8005 and type "SHUTDOWN".
		- This element defines the overall config for the tomcat server instance.se
			# telnet localhost 8005
			# 'SHUTDOWN'
		<Server port="8005" shutdown="SHUTDOWN">


		ii) Service Element:
			- used to define a group of settings that control how Tomcat processes incoming requests for a specific service. 
			- "Catalina" is just a name for this particular service group within Tomcat.
			- Defines a collection of Connectors and an Engine. 
			<Service name="Catalina">

		iii) Connector Element: defines how tomcat receives requests. It listens for client requests on a specific port.
			<Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1" connectionTimeout="20000" redirectPort="8443" />

		iv) Engine Element: This part processes the incoming requests and determines how to handle them.
			<Engine name="Catalina" defaultHost="localhost">

		v) Host Element: Defines a virtual host, which is a domain or subdomain.
			<Host name="localhost" appBase="webapps"
      unpackWARs="true" autoDeploy="true">

      vi) Context Element: defines a web app that is to be ran within selected virtual host.
			 <Context path="" docBase="myapp" reloadable="true"/>

EXAMPLE:
	<Server port="8005" shutdown="SHUTDOWN">
    <Service name="Catalina">

        <!-- Connector for HTTP requests on port 8080 -->
        <Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
                   connectionTimeout="20000"
                   redirectPort="8443" />

        <!-- Engine that processes requests -->
        <Engine name="Catalina" defaultHost="localhost">

            <!-- Host for the localhost domain -->
            <Host name="localhost" appBase="webapps"
                  unpackWARs="true" autoDeploy="true">

                <!-- Context for the web application -->
                <Context path="" docBase="myapp" reloadable="true"/>
                
            </Host>
        </Engine>
    </Service>
</Server>
