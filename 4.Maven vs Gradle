i) Configuration
	- Maven uses XML configuration (pom.xml) and it is more declarative.
	- Gradle uses Groovy or Kotlin DSL for configuration (build.gradle or build.gradle.kts) and it is more flexible.

ii) Dependency Management
	- Maven manages dependencies through a central repository (Maven Central) and their dependencies are declared in the "pom.xml" file.
	- Gradle also manages dependencies from repositories like Maven Central and others and their dependencies are declared in the "build.gradle" file.

iii) Build Performance
	- Maven executes goals and phases sequentially. Slower for large projects due to its less efficient handling of tasks.
	- Gradle utilizes incremental builds, only re-executing tasks that have changed. Faster for larger projects with many tasks.

iv) Community and Ecosystem
	- Maven had older and more mature with a larger repository of plugins and libraries. Strong community support and extensive documentation.	
	- Gradle has newer community but rapidly growing in popularity. Modern features and better suited for multi-language projects.

SUMMARY
	- Maven: Best for standard Java projects that benefit from a structured, declarative approach with mature tooling and community support.

	- Gradle: Ideal for complex and multi-language projects that require a flexible, scriptable build tool with modern performance features.	

EXAMPLE
    - Maven (pom.xml)

    <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>junit</groupId>
            <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
            <version>4.12</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</project>

	- Gradle (build.gradle)

	plugins {
    	id 'java'
    }

	repositories {
    	mavenCentral()
    }

	dependencies {
     	testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.12'
    }
