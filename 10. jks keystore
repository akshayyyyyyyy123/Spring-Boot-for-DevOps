10. What is a JKS Keystore?
-> Purpose:
	* Storage: A JKS keystore is used to securely store cryptographic keys (like SSL/TLS keys) and their corresponding digital certificates.

	* Security: It provides a way to manage and protect sensitive information such as private keys and certificates used for encryption, authentication, and integrity verification in Java applications.

	* Contents:
		- Private Keys: Encrypted private keys used for server-side authentication or data encryption.

		- Certificates: Digital certificates issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs) that authenticate the identity of servers or clients in secure communications.

		- Trust Anchors: Public keys of trusted entities used to validate certificates presented by others.

	* File Format:

A JKS keystore is typically stored as a file (e.g., keystore.jks) on the file system.
It uses Java's proprietary format for storing keys and certificates securely.
Importance and Usage
SSL/TLS Configuration: In web servers (like Apache Tomcat), a JKS keystore is used to store SSL/TLS certificates and private keys used to secure HTTPS connections.
Authentication: It's crucial for authenticating clients and servers in secure communication channels.
Encryption: Enables encryption and decryption of sensitive data using secure keys stored in the keystore.
Java Applications: Commonly used in Java-based applications to manage security credentials required for secure communication protocols.
